# random scales
I needed a randomizer to exercise on scales during warmup. Here it is

`npm start` to start playing in local host

`tsc` inside the app folder builds the app
`tsc` inside the tests builds the test

# todo


* add gulp script for test, build (rather than running tsc inside the folders...)
* deploy
* research more into exports
