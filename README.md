# random scales
I needed a randomizer to exercise on scales during warmup. So here it is.

look at `gulpfile.js` or `package.json` for how to run locally.

Tests have intellisense!

# todo


* add logic to figure out the accidents per each scale (on demand).
* private setters, public getters to improve tests for random scale
* deploy
* structure folders for files
* modularize app

* gulp to run a single test file
* concatenate / minify files
* selenium
* tsconfig.base does it work in gulp?
